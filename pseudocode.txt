problem:
Your calculator should not evaluate more than a single pair of numbers at a time. Example: you press a number button (12), followed by an operator button (+), a second number button (7), and finally a second operator button (-). Your calculator should then do the following: first, evaluate the first pair of numbers (12 + 7), second, display the result of that calculation (19), and finally, use that result (19) as the first number in your new calculation, along with the next operator (-). An example of the behavior we’re looking for can be seen in this student’s calculator live preview.


what i think i need to do:
* if user doesnt press equals, but instead presses another operator, do the following:
perform the calculation of the pair of numbers entered
store the result in a variable, then use that result as the first number of the next pair.
then use that operator as on the next number
so (12+7) - 5, should becomes: result(19) - 5. when the user THEN presses equals, it should display: 14.
if the user doesnt press equals, but instead yet another operator, do the same operations again. use the result of the previous calculation, add the operator, then wait for new number



start with, removing the numbers, except the result, which ill add to a variable
