problem:
Your calculator should not evaluate more than a single pair of numbers at a time. Example: you press a number button (12), followed by an operator button (+), a second number button (7), and finally a second operator button (-). Your calculator should then do the following: first, evaluate the first pair of numbers (12 + 7), second, display the result of that calculation (19), and finally, use that result (19) as the first number in your new calculation, along with the next operator (-). An example of the behavior we’re looking for can be seen in this student’s calculator live preview.


if user presses an operator a SECOND time, evaluate the pair in the array
//add that result to [0] in the array, wait for next input, add that to [1]
//return results?
